# XML to JSON Converter

This script converts an XML file to a JSON file using Python. It parses the XML file, converts it into a dictionary, and then writes the dictionary to a JSON file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `xml.etree.ElementTree` (standard library)
- `collections.OrderedDict` (standard library)
- `json` (standard library)

## Usage

1. **Prepare your XML file**: Ensure your XML file is named appropriately and located in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path.

2. **Update the script**: Modify the `xml_file` and `json_file` variables in the script to match your XML file name and desired JSON output file name. (mine = books.xml  & output.json)

3. **Run the script**: Execute the script using Python.

```bash
python xml_to_json_converter.py
python xml_to_json_converter2.py
